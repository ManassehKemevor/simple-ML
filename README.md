this is a simple machine learning project that predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant in the breast using 30 useful features
the algorithm used to solve this problem was the Support Vector Classifier(SVC)
the code is in two sections
the first part was just a simple approach using the SVC without any hyperparameter tuning
the second part was also just a simple approach using the SVC with hyperparameter tuning using a gridsearch for the best hyperparameter
of course! the hyperparameter tuning approach gave the best accuracy score
