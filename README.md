This is a simple machine learning project that predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant in the breast using 30 useful features.
The algorithm used to solve this problem was the Support Vector Classifier(SVC).
The code is in two sections:
1.The first part was just a simple approach using the SVC without any hyperparameter tuning
2.The second part was also just a simple approach using the SVC with hyperparameter tuning using a gridsearch for the best hyperparameter
of course! the hyperparameter tuning approach gave the best accuracy score
